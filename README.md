# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

This command-line application allows users to generate SVG logos by providing input for text, text color, shape, and shape color. Once all prompts are answered, the application creates an SVG file named `logo.svg` and prints "Generated logo.svg" in the command line. Users can then open the generated `logo.svg` file in a browser to view the logo.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

## Usage

To use the logo generator, follow these steps:

1. Run the application in your terminal.
2. You will be prompted to enter text. Enter up to three characters.
3. Next, you will be prompted to enter the text color. You can enter a color keyword (e.g., "red", "blue", "green") or a hexadecimal number.
4. After that, you will be presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square. Enter the shape you want.
5. Lastly, you will be prompted to enter the shape's color. Similar to text color, you can enter a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.

Once you have entered input for all prompts, the application will create an SVG file named `logo.svg` in the project directory and print "Generated logo.svg" in the command line.

## Viewing the Logo

Open the generated `logo.svg` file in a browser to view the logo. The image will be displayed as a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria you entered.
